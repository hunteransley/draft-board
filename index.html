        <h1 style="font-size:36px;font-weight:900;margin:0 0 8px">Big Board Lab — The Most Realistic 2026 NFL Mock Draft Simulator</h1>
        <p style="font-size:16px;color:#525252;margin:0 0 32px">32 AI GMs with real team needs. CPU-to-CPU trades. Live depth charts. Grade prospects by sliding traits up and down — get instant steal/reach verdicts. Free, no signup required.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">Build Your 2026 NFL Big Board</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Build your personal NFL prospect rankings through pair-by-pair matchups. Choose between two players at a time — no spreadsheets needed. Your big board builds itself using an Elo rating system that adapts to your preferences. Fine-tune grades by sliding position-specific traits up and down: arm strength, burst, route running, coverage instincts, bend, press technique, and more. Every position has its own set of traits that matter.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">The Most Realistic Mock Draft Simulator Ever Built</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Run 1 to 7 round mock drafts powered by 32 AI general managers, each with unique draft personalities modeled on real NFL teams. The Bengals favor best player available. The Saints reach for needs. The Eagles draft like a dynasty. CPU teams evaluate prospects based on scheme fit (3-4 vs 4-3 defensive fronts), positional value, team needs from live depth charts, and team stage — rebuild, retool, contend, or dynasty.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">CPU Teams Trade With Each Other</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Big Board Lab is one of the only mock draft simulators where AI teams trade with each other during the draft. When elite prospects slide or a team falls in love with a player, aggressive GMs trade up — just like real NFL draft night. The Rams, Saints, Chiefs, and other historically aggressive teams initiate trades more often. Trade frequency matches real-world data averaging 3 to 5 first-round trades per draft, with fair-value checks ensuring realistic trade packages.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">Live ESPN-Powered Depth Charts</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Every draft pick is automatically slotted into the selecting team's real NFL depth chart, powered by ESPN roster data. See whether a prospect projects as a Day 1 starter, a rotational backup, or an upgrade over existing players. A formation-style depth chart visualization shows the full offense and defense with drafted players highlighted in purple. Watch team needs evolve in real time as the draft progresses — EDGE rushers slot into DE spots, not DT, and safeties land at SS or FS based on their actual position.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">Every Pick Graded Instantly</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Get an instant verdict on every selection — steal, value, or reach — based on consensus rankings and draft position. Track your overall draft grade with a letter grade that updates after every pick. If you've made trades, see your trade surplus or deficit in draft value points. Share your completed draft results as branded canvas images with your picks, grades, verdicts, and formation depth chart.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px;margin:32px 0 12px">450+ Prospects With Granular Position Filters</h2>
        <p style="color:#525252">Comprehensive 2026 NFL Draft prospect database covering every position with granular filters: QB, RB, WR, TE, OT, IOL, EDGE, IDL, LB, CB, S, and K/P. Consensus grades and rankings compiled from industry sources, with full support for custom evaluations. Reset rankings per position if you want to start fresh on just one group without losing your work on others.</p>
