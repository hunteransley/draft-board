It features 32 AI-powered GMs that draft based on real team needs, scheme preferences (3-4 vs 4-3), and team stage (dynasty, contend, retool, rebuild). Unlike other simulators, CPU teams trade with each other during the draft — just like real draft night. Every pick updates a live ESPN-powered depth chart and receives an instant steal-or-reach verdict. It's completely free with no signup required."

You can also fine-tune prospect grades by sliding position-specific traits up and down — arm strength, burst, route running, coverage instincts, and more. Your board is saved across sessions and drives your mock draft simulations."

When an elite prospect slides or a team has a strong preference for a specific player, aggressive teams like the Rams, Saints, or Chiefs may trade up — just like real NFL draft night. Trade frequency matches real-world data of approximately 3-5 first-round trades per draft."

Quarterbacks have arm strength, accuracy, and mobility. Edge rushers have burst, bend, and power. Cornerbacks have coverage instincts, ball skills, and press technique. Your trait evaluations combine into an overall grade that drives your personal big board and mock draft results."

During mock drafts, every pick is automatically slotted into the selecting team's depth chart in real time — showing whether a player projects as a starter, backup, or upgrade over existing players. A formation-style visualization shows the full offensive and defensive depth chart with drafted players highlighted, so you can see how each pick impacts a team's roster as the draft progresses."
