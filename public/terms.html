    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>Big Board Lab is a free NFL draft board builder and mock draft simulator. You can rank prospects head-to-head, grade them with trait sliders, and run mock drafts against 32 AI-powered general managers. It's built for fans, by fans.</p>

    <h2>Your Account & Data</h2>
    <p>You can sign in with Google to save your work. When you do, we store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your board rankings and Elo ratings</li>
      <li>Trait grades and scouting notes you create</li>
      <li>Mock draft results and history</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use Supabase for authentication and data storage. We don't sell your data, and we don't share it with third parties. If you use the site as a guest without signing in, nothing is saved — your session data lives in your browser and disappears when you leave.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>Big Board Lab is for personal, non-commercial use. You're welcome to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build boards, run mocks, share your results with friends</li>
      <li>Screenshot or share your draft results on social media</li>
      <li>Use it for fantasy football research, podcasts, or content creation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please don't:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scrape, crawl, or bulk-export data from the site</li>
      <li>Resell or redistribute our prospect data, rankings, or AI draft logic</li>
      <li>Use automated tools to spam the service or abuse rate limits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The tool, its design, the AI draft engine, and the underlying code belong to Big Board Lab. Your personal rankings, trait grades, scouting notes, and mock draft results belong to you. We won't use your individual board data for anything other than powering your experience on the site.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>Consensus rankings are aggregated from publicly available mock drafts and prospect evaluations across the draft community. Combine measurables come from official NFL and publicly reported sources. Team depth charts are sourced from ESPN. We do our best to keep everything accurate and up to date, but we're a small operation — if something looks off, let us know.</p>

    <h2>No Warranty</h2>
    <p>Big Board Lab is provided as-is, free of charge. We make no guarantees about uptime, accuracy, or availability. It's a free fan tool — we build it because we love the draft, not because we're contractually obligated to keep it running at four nines. That said, we do our best.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
