    <h2>Two Types of Trades</h2>

    <p>There's a fundamental difference between user-to-CPU trades and CPU-to-CPU trades that most comparison articles miss.</p>

    <p><strong>User-to-CPU trades</strong> let you initiate trades with AI teams or respond to trade offers they send you. This is useful — you can trade up for your guy, trade down for more picks, or respond to a team that wants your spot. But it only changes your position. The rest of the draft plays out as a static sequence.</p>

    <p><strong>CPU-to-CPU trades</strong> let AI teams trade with each other independently. This changes the entire draft order for everyone. When the Saints trade up from 14 to 6, every team picking between 6 and 14 is affected. Players you expected to be available at your pick might be gone. A team behind you might jump ahead. The board becomes unpredictable in the same way real draft night is unpredictable.</p>

    <p>In real NFL drafts, both types happen. Teams trade with each other 3-5 times in the first round. A simulator that only supports user-to-CPU trades is missing half of what makes the draft dynamic.</p>

    <h2>The Best Trade Experiences</h2>

    <h3>For User-Initiated Trades: FanSpeak</h3>
    <p>FanSpeak's trade system is the most polished user-to-CPU experience. The Jimmy Johnson chart gives every pick a point value, and the interface clearly shows whether a trade is fair, a slight overpay, or lopsided. In Team Needs mode, CPU teams require you to overpay by at least 100 chart points, simulating realistic negotiation difficulty. It's intuitive, transparent, and well-designed.</p>

    <h3>For CPU-to-CPU Trades: Big Board Lab</h3>
    <p>Big Board Lab's CPU-to-CPU system is the most transparent and detailed. Each AI GM has a trade aggressiveness profile modeled on real team behavior — the Rams and Saints are frequent traders, the Bengals and Steelers rarely move. Trades are triggered by specific conditions: elite prospect slides and strong scheme-specific needs. A fair-value check ensures packages meet minimum value thresholds. Trade frequency matches real NFL data of 3-5 first-round trades per draft.</p>

    <h3>For Both: Pro Football Network</h3>
    <p>Pro Football Network is the best free option that offers both user-to-CPU and sim-to-sim trades. The interface is clean, the trade functionality works well, and you can choose from multiple big boards. The main weakness is that the trade tool doesn't indicate fairness the way FanSpeak does.</p>

    <h2>Trades You Can't Get Elsewhere</h2>

    <p>PFF locks all trade functionality behind a paywall. If you want trades in PFF, you're paying for PFF+. FanSpeak offers basic trades on the free tier but saves the best features for premium. Big Board Lab, Pro Football Network, NFL Draft Buzz, and Sportskeeda all offer their trade systems completely free.</p>

    <p>The real differentiator is CPU-to-CPU trades — and only three simulators offer them. If realistic draft chaos matters to you, that narrows the field significantly.</p>
