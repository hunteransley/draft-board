This forces you to adapt your strategy on the fly instead of simply waiting for your pick."

    <h1>Which Mock Draft Simulators Have CPU-to-CPU Trades?</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Most simulators only let you trade with the computer. Here's which ones let AI teams trade with each other — and how each system actually works.</p>
    <p class="date">Updated February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="answer-box">
      <p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> Three simulators offer CPU-to-CPU trades in 2026: <strong>Big Board Lab</strong> (32 distinct AI GMs with team-specific behavior), <strong>NFL Draft Buzz</strong> (toggle-based CPU trade system), and <strong>Pro Football Network</strong> (sim-to-sim trades). Every other major simulator — PFF, FanSpeak, NFL Mock Draft Database, StickToTheModel, Sportskeeda, Mock Draft Hero — only supports user-to-CPU trades.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why CPU-to-CPU Trades Matter</h2>

    <p>In real NFL drafts, teams trade with each other constantly. The first round alone typically sees 3-5 trades — sometimes more. When Cam Ward starts sliding, somebody is calling to move up. When a team at pick 15 falls in love with an edge rusher still on the board at 8, they're working the phones.</p>

    <p>Without CPU-to-CPU trades, your mock draft exists in a world where only you can change the order. Every other team sits at their assigned pick and waits. That's not how the draft works. CPU-to-CPU trades add the unpredictability that makes a simulation feel real — because it mirrors what actually happens.</p>

    <h3>Big Board Lab</h3>

    <p>Big Board Lab's trade system is built around 32 AI general managers that each behave differently. Trade aggressiveness varies by team — the Rams, Saints, and Chiefs are historically aggressive and initiate trades more often. The Bengals and Steelers are conservative and rarely move up.</p>

    <p>Trades are triggered by specific conditions: when an elite prospect slides past their projected range, or when a team has a strong scheme-specific need for a player still on the board. A separation threshold prevents trades for marginal upgrades — the AI needs a genuine reason to pay the cost of moving up.</p>

    <p>Each team also has a stage — dynasty, contend, retool, or rebuild — that influences trade behavior. Dynasty teams are less likely to trade future capital. Rebuilding teams are more likely to trade down. Trade frequency is calibrated to match real NFL data: roughly 3-5 trades in the first round, which is what you see on actual draft night.</p>

    <p>The trade evaluation includes a fair-value check using a standard draft value chart, requiring packages to meet a minimum value threshold. This prevents unrealistic lopsided trades. Every trade appears in the pick feed with a trade indicator so you can see exactly what happened.</p>

    <h3>NFL Draft Buzz</h3>

    <p>NFL Draft Buzz offers a CPU-to-CPU trade toggle in the simulation settings. When enabled, AI teams can execute trades during the draft. Their interface calls this an "exclusive feature" and recommends enabling it for the most realistic experience.</p>

    <p>The underlying logic of their trade system isn't publicly documented — it's not clear what triggers trades or how team-specific the behavior is. But the toggle exists and adds unpredictability to the draft when enabled.</p>

    <h3>Pro Football Network</h3>

    <p>Pro Football Network offers sim-to-sim trade functionality. Their system allows AI-controlled teams to execute trades during the simulation, though the specifics of how trade decisions are made aren't detailed publicly. They also offer user-to-sim and sim-to-user trade modes.</p>

    <h2>What About User-to-CPU Trades?</h2>

    <p>Almost every simulator offers some form of user-to-CPU trading. PFF offers it for paid subscribers. FanSpeak uses the Jimmy Johnson trade value chart. Sportskeeda throws trade offers at you mid-round. StickToTheModel has a value-based trade calculator.</p>

    <p>User-to-CPU trades are useful — you can trade up for your guy or trade down to accumulate picks. But they only change the order from your perspective. The rest of the draft plays out as if no other team has any interest in moving. That's the gap that CPU-to-CPU trades fill.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>If CPU-to-CPU trades are important to you — and for realistic simulations, they should be — your options are Big Board Lab, NFL Draft Buzz, and Pro Football Network. Big Board Lab is the most transparent about how its trade AI works and the only one that models 32 distinct team personalities with stage-specific behavior. All three are free.</p>
