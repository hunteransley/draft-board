Fernando Mendoza is a near-lock for the top 5. Ty Simpson (Alabama) is the next QB most likely to go in Round 1, though some analysts have him as a late first or early second rounder.

The thin QB class means some teams may wait until 2027 for a stronger quarterback group."}}],"license":"https://bigboardlab.com/terms.html"}

    <h1>Best Quarterback Prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Mendoza leads a thin but interesting class. Here's every QB worth knowing.</p>
    <p class="date">Updated February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>Class overview:</strong> This is widely considered a one-quarterback-in-the-top-10 draft. Fernando Mendoza is the clear QB1 and a likely #1 overall pick. After him, there's a cluster of Day 2 quarterbacks with starter upside — Ty Simpson, Garrett Nussmeier, and Carson Beck — followed by developmental arms on Day 3. Teams desperate for a franchise QB may need to overpay to trade up for Mendoza or wait for the 2027 class.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Rankings</h2>

    <div class="prospect">
      <h3 class="prospect-header">1. Fernando Mendoza — Indiana</h3>
      <p class="prospect-meta">6-5, 225 lbs · Heisman Trophy Winner · Projected: Top 5 (likely #1 overall)</p>
      <p>Mendoza is exactly what modern NFL offenses want. He's a precise, efficient pocket passer who excels in quick-game concepts, RPOs, and timing routes while maintaining the arm talent to push the ball downfield on play-action shots. His 2025 season was dominant — 72% completion, 3,535 yards, 41 touchdowns, 6 interceptions — while leading Indiana to a national championship.</p>
      <p>At 6-5 with a strong arm and advanced processing, Mendoza is the most pro-ready quarterback in the class. His weaknesses are relatively minor: he can be slow to escape the pocket under pressure, and his time to throw is occasionally too long for a pocket quarterback. But his accuracy, decision-making, and pocket presence are legitimate first-overall-pick traits.</p>
      <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Arm strength (above average), accuracy (elite), pocket presence (elite), processing speed (above average), mobility (average).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prospect">
      <h3 class="prospect-header">2. Ty Simpson — Alabama</h3>
      <p class="prospect-meta">6-2, 208 lbs · Projected: Late Round 1 / Early Round 2</p>
      <p>Simpson is one of the more fascinating prospects in recent memory — a first-year starter who showed elite command through his initial games before the reality of SEC competition tested his consistency. He's an escape artist in the pocket with good lower-body fundamentals and a compact throwing base. His size (6-2, 208) is on the smaller end for NFL quarterbacks, but his ability to sift through pressure and create from a strong, balanced base is impressive.</p>
      <p>The question with Simpson is sample size. He doesn't have multiple seasons of starting tape, which makes projection harder. But the tools and instincts are clearly there.</p>
      <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Arm strength (average), accuracy (above average), pocket presence (above average), processing speed (developing), mobility (elite).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prospect">
      <h3 class="prospect-header">3. Garrett Nussmeier — LSU</h3>
      <p class="prospect-meta">6-2, 200 lbs · Projected: Round 2-3</p>
      <p>Nussmeier's 2025 season was derailed by an abdominal injury that limited him to roughly half a season, but his 2024 tape and Senior Bowl performance confirmed the talent: 4,052 yards and 29 touchdowns as a junior with a powerful arm that has no problem going vertical. He spent years behind Jayden Daniels learning Brian Kelly's pro-style system, and the NFL preparation shows.</p>
      <p>The injury-shortened 2025 creates a discount. Teams that watched his 2024 film know this is a potential starting-caliber quarterback who might be available in the second or third round. Every team that needs a quarterback but can't get Mendoza should be looking here.</p>
      <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Arm strength (elite), accuracy (above average), pocket presence (above average), processing speed (average), mobility (below average).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prospect">
      <h3 class="prospect-header">4. Carson Beck — Miami</h3>
      <p class="prospect-meta">6-4, 220 lbs · Projected: Round 3-5</p>
      <p>Beck transferred from Georgia to Miami and showed improvement under the Hurricanes' coaching staff — 72% completion, 3,813 yards, 30 touchdowns. He has a power arm, NFL size, and showed improved poise and composure compared to his time in Athens. The concerns are well-documented: he can struggle under pressure, and his 12 interceptions show that decision-making remains inconsistent.</p>
      <p>Beck has the physical tools of a starting NFL quarterback. Whether he can put it all together consistently is the gamble teams will be evaluating through the draft process.</p>
      <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Arm strength (above average), accuracy (average), pocket presence (average), processing speed (average), mobility (below average).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prospect">
      <h3 class="prospect-header">5. Drew Allar — Penn State</h3>
      <p class="prospect-meta">6-5, 235 lbs · Projected: Round 3-5</p>
      <p>Allar has elite size and has flashed ability across his Penn State career, but a season-ending leg injury in October 2025 limited his final tape to a handful of games. When healthy, he completed 67% with 24 touchdowns in 2024. He needs development with his footwork and field vision, but the raw physical tools — especially at 6-5, 235 — make him an intriguing developmental option for a team willing to be patient.</p>
      <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Arm strength (above average), accuracy (average), pocket presence (developing), processing speed (developing), mobility (average).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Day 3 and Beyond</h2>

    <p>Behind the top 5, there are several quarterbacks who could hear their names on Day 3 or earn roster spots as undrafted free agents. Cade Klubnik (Clemson) is a smart, compact passer who doesn't have elite arm talent but plays within structure. Cole Payton (North Dakota State) is the wild card — an inexperienced one-year starter who threw 16 touchdowns and ran for 13 more, offering dual-threat upside with a wide range of outcomes. Luke Altmyer (Illinois) improved his completion percentage to a career-high 67.4% in 2025 and offers enough athleticism to make plays outside the pocket.</p>

    <p>Diego Pavia (Vanderbilt) may be the most fun prospect in the class regardless of draft position — arguably the greatest quarterback in Commodores history, but at 5-9 and under 200 pounds, his NFL path is steep. His competitive fire is undeniable and should at least earn him a shot in camp.</p>

    <h2>How This Class Affects Your Mock Draft</h2>

    <p>With only 1-2 first-round quarterbacks, the 2026 draft is going to be defined by defensive talent and the offensive line. Teams picking in the top 10 who don't need a QB will have their pick of elite edge rushers, cornerbacks, and tackles. Teams that do need a QB face a tough choice: pay a premium to trade up for Mendoza, or gamble on Simpson/Nussmeier in Round 2.</p>

    <p>In Big Board Lab's mock draft simulator, you can test these scenarios yourself. The AI GMs model real team needs — the Raiders are virtually locked in on Mendoza at #1 — so you'll see how the QB-needy teams actually behave when the class is this thin. Do the Browns trade up? Does a team reach for Simpson in the teens? Run it and find out.</p>
