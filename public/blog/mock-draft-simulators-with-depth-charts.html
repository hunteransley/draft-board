Without depth charts, you're guessing whether a pick addresses a real need.

You can also see whether a drafted player projects as a Day 1 starter or a rotational backup behind established players. This context changes how you evaluate every pick."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do any mock draft simulators show where drafted players fit on the roster?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Big Board Lab is the only simulator that shows where drafted players slot into the existing roster in real time. When a team drafts an edge rusher, you can see whether they're replacing a departing starter, competing with an established player, or providing depth behind a Pro Bowler.

    <h1>Which Mock Draft Simulators Show Depth Charts?</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Most simulators tell you what a team needs. Only one shows you exactly where each pick fits on the roster.</p>
    <p class="date">Updated February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> Big Board Lab is the only mock draft simulator in 2026 that integrates live depth charts powered by ESPN roster data. Every pick is automatically slotted into the selecting team's depth chart in real time, showing starter/backup projections and how needs shift after each selection. Other simulators display team needs lists but don't show the full roster context.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Problem With Team Needs Lists</h2>

    <p>Every mock draft simulator tells you something about team needs. Some show a ranked list of positions. Some highlight needs in the draft board. But a needs list doesn't give you the full picture.</p>

    <p>Consider: "Team X needs CB" is useful. But it doesn't tell you that their CB1 is a 27-year-old Pro Bowler, their CB2 is a 31-year-old pending free agent, and their CB3 is a fifth-round pick from last year who allowed a 78% completion rate. That context completely changes how you evaluate a CB pick for that team. Are they drafting a future CB1? A replacement for an aging CB2? Depth behind an established duo?</p>

    <p>Without the depth chart, you're guessing. With it, you're roster-building.</p>

    <h2>How Big Board Lab's Depth Charts Work</h2>

    <p>Big Board Lab pulls real depth chart data from ESPN for all 32 NFL teams. When a mock draft begins, each team's roster is loaded with current starters and backups at every position.</p>

    <p>Every time a pick is made — by you or by the AI — the selected player is automatically slotted into the correct position on the depth chart. This isn't a simple "add name to a list" operation. The system maps each prospect to their specific roster slot:</p>

    <p>EDGE rushers go to DE1 or DE2 — not DT. Interior defensive linemen go to DT slots. Safeties are placed at SS or FS based on their actual position profile. Cornerbacks slot to CB1 or CB2. Offensive tackles go to LT or RT. The mapping is position-specific and granular.</p>

    <p>A formation-style visualization shows the full depth chart with drafted players highlighted in purple. You can see at a glance which positions have been addressed and which remain thin. As the draft progresses, you can watch a team's roster transform — holes get filled, depth gets built, and remaining needs become clearer.</p>

    <h2>Why This Changes How You Mock Draft</h2>

    <p>When you can see the depth chart, your picks become more informed. Instead of drafting a corner because "the team needs CB," you're drafting a corner because you can see that CB2 is a weakness and this prospect has the press technique to start immediately in this team's man-heavy scheme.</p>

    <p>It also changes how you evaluate the CPU's picks. When the AI Eagles draft an edge rusher in Round 2 even though they already have two quality starters, you understand why — they're building a rotation, the way real dynasty teams do. Without the depth chart, that pick looks like a reach. With it, it makes perfect sense.</p>

    <p>The depth chart integration also drives the AI GM behavior. Teams don't just draft from a generic needs list — they evaluate their actual roster depth at each position and prioritize based on what the depth chart shows. A team with two solid cornerbacks but no safety is going to value a safety much higher than another corner, even if both positions are technically "needs."</p>

    <h2>What Other Simulators Offer Instead</h2>

    <p>Most mock draft simulators provide some form of team needs information, but none integrate live depth charts:</p>

    <p>PFF shows team needs and offers excellent player data, but doesn't display the full roster depth chart during the simulation. FanSpeak has a Team Needs mode that influences CPU behavior and draft grades, but it's a ranked list of positions rather than a visual depth chart. NFL Mock Draft Database and StickToTheModel show needs-based information to guide your picks. NFL Draft Buzz allows you to add drafted players to a depth chart after the mock is complete, but not during the live simulation.</p>

    <p>Big Board Lab is the only tool where the depth chart is live, integrated into the simulation, and updated automatically with every pick in real time.</p>
