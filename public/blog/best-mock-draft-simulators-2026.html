    <h1>Best Free NFL Mock Draft Simulators for 2026 — Compared</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">An honest look at every major mock draft simulator, what each does well, and where they fall short.</p>
    <p class="date">Updated February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="tldr">
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you want the deepest prospect data and don't mind paying, PFF is the gold standard. If you want free with the most realistic draft simulation — CPU teams that trade with each other, distinct AI GM personalities, and live depth charts — Big Board Lab is the only tool that combines all three. If you want clean and simple with a good trade calculator, Pro Football Network or FanSpeak are solid choices.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are at least nine mock draft simulators competing for your attention this draft season. We've used all of them extensively. Some are great. Some are frustrating. Most are decent but missing something. Here's what we found.</p>

    <h2>What We Looked For</h2>

    <p>Mock draft simulators all do the same basic thing: you pick a team, you make selections, CPU teams fill in the rest. The difference is in the details — how realistic the CPU picks are, whether teams can trade, how prospects are evaluated, and whether you can actually see the impact of each pick on a real roster.</p>

    <p>We evaluated each simulator on five things: how realistic the AI drafting behavior is, whether and how trades work, how prospects are evaluated and graded, whether you can see depth chart impact, and how much is free versus paywalled.</p>

    <h2>The Simulators</h2>

    <h3>PFF Mock Draft Simulator</h3>

    <p>PFF has the best prospect data in the industry, period. Three-year player grades, advanced stats, position rankings, and real scouting reports from Trevor Sikkema. Their Scouting Mode lets you build custom evaluations. If you're a serious draft analyst, this is the data you want.</p>

    <p>The catch is price. The free tier limits you to three rounds with no trades. Unlocking trades, full seven-round drafts, and the leaderboard requires a PFF+ subscription. The CPU drafting is competent but generic — there's no sense that the Saints draft differently than the Bengals. No CPU-to-CPU trades. No depth chart integration. You're paying for data quality, not simulation realism.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Serious prospect evaluation with premium data. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Paywalled features, generic CPU behavior.</p>

    <h3>FanSpeak On The Clock</h3>

    <p>FanSpeak has been around for years and the experience is polished. The trade calculator uses the Jimmy Johnson chart, which is the same system real NFL front offices reference. Multi-team drafting is available for premium users. Draft grades break down both value and need components clearly.</p>

    <p>The free tier is usable but limited. CPU behavior is fine but not differentiated by team. The big board system is flexible — you can import custom rankings or choose from presets. No CPU-to-CPU trades, no depth chart integration. It's a reliable, proven tool that hasn't innovated much recently.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Multi-team drafting with trade calculator. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Premium lock on best features, static CPU behavior.</p>

    <h3>NFL Mock Draft Database</h3>

    <p>The consensus big board is the killer feature here. They aggregate mock drafts from across the industry, so the board reflects where the entire draft community thinks each player will go. This makes for realistic drafts even if the CPU AI is basic. The site also offers premium features including scouting reports.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Consensus-driven drafting with industry-aggregated data. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Some features paywalled, no CPU-to-CPU trades.</p>

    <h3>Pro Football Network</h3>

    <p>Clean interface, completely free, with a solid database selector that lets you choose which big board to draft from — PFF, ESPN, The Athletic, PFSN's own, or consensus. They offer sim-to-sim trades, which is a real differentiator. The player info integration is strong enough to research prospects while you draft.</p>

    <p>Where it falls short: the trade tool doesn't indicate fairness, and you can't bundle position groups in the prospect view — it's full board or one position at a time. But for free, this is one of the best overall experiences.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Free, clean experience with multiple board options. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Trade fairness indicator missing, limited position filtering.</p>

    <h3>StickToTheModel</h3>

    <p>The indie underdog that's earned its spot. Clean design, completely free, with AI they claim is trained on 300,000+ real draft picks. They do a good job presenting scheme fit for each prospect, which helps if you're not deep in the draft weeds. They also publish strategy content — their blog post on mock draft strategy is genuinely useful.</p>

    <p>The simulation is solid but CPU teams don't trade with each other. No depth chart integration. Prospect evaluation is consensus-based without custom grading tools.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Clean free experience with good scheme fit info. <strong>Limitation:</strong> No CPU-to-CPU trades, no custom prospect grading.</p>

    <h3>NFL Draft Buzz</h3>

    <p>Visually one of the more distinctive simulators. They do offer CPU-to-CPU trades, which is rare. The interface has a lot going on — draft tracker, trade console, prospect scouting panel, all visible at once. For some people this is immersive; for others it's overwhelming.</p>

    <p>The rankings are maintained in-house and don't always stay current. The substance of the CPU AI behind the trades isn't transparent — you can't tell why teams are trading or what drives their behavior. But the CPU-to-CPU toggle is a legitimate differentiator that adds unpredictability.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> CPU-to-CPU trades with a feature-dense interface. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Busy UI, proprietary rankings can lag behind.</p>

    <h3>Sportskeeda</h3>

    <p>Powered by draft expert Tony Pauline's rankings, which gives it credibility. The trade system works mid-round, which is a nice touch. Three speed options let you control pacing. It's completely free.</p>

    <p>The simulation AI is basic. CPU behavior doesn't vary by team in any meaningful way. No depth chart integration. No CPU-to-CPU trades. It does the fundamentals well enough but doesn't push the envelope on realism.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Expert-backed rankings in a free, simple package. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Basic AI, no CPU trades, no depth charts.</p>

    <h3>Mock Draft Hero</h3>

    <p>A sleeper pick that's surprisingly clean. Multiple big board options, easy-to-use interface, completely free. It doesn't try to do too much, which works in its favor — the core drafting experience is smooth.</p>

    <p>Limited features compared to the bigger names. No CPU-to-CPU trades, no depth charts, no prospect grading tools. But if you just want a quick, clean mock without a lot of friction, it's worth trying.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick, clean mocks with no friction. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Fewer features than competitors.</p>

    <h3>Big Board Lab</h3>

    <p>Full disclosure: this is us. We built Big Board Lab because we wanted a simulator that combined prospect evaluation with realistic draft behavior — and none of the existing tools did both.</p>

    <p>Here's what makes it different. The mock draft is powered by 32 AI general managers, each with a distinct drafting personality modeled on real NFL teams. The Bengals favor the best player available. The Saints are aggressive and reach for needs. The Eagles draft like a dynasty with deep roster depth. Each team evaluates prospects based on scheme fit (3-4 vs 4-3 defensive fronts), positional value, needs from their actual depth chart, and team stage — rebuild, retool, contend, or dynasty.</p>

    <p>CPU teams trade with each other during the draft. When an elite prospect slides past where they're projected, aggressive teams like the Rams, Saints, or Chiefs may trade up to grab them. Trade frequency is calibrated to match real NFL data — roughly 3-5 first-round trades per draft, not every other pick.</p>

    <p>Every pick lands on a live ESPN-powered depth chart. You can see exactly where a prospect slots — starter, backup, or upgrade — and how the team's needs shift after each selection. EDGE rushers go to DE slots, not DT. Safeties land at SS or FS. The position mapping is specific, not generic.</p>

    <p>For prospect evaluation, you build your big board through pair-by-pair matchups — pick between two players at a time, and an Elo rating system builds your rankings automatically. Then fine-tune with trait sliders: slide arm strength, burst, coverage instincts, route running, and other position-specific attributes up and down to build your own grades. Every pick gets an instant steal/reach/value verdict.</p>

    <p>It's completely free. No paywall, no signup, no credit card.</p>

    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most realistic draft simulation with distinct AI team behavior, CPU trades, and live depth charts. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Newer tool with a smaller prospect database than PFF, no multi-team drafting yet.</p>

    <h2>So Which One Should You Use?</h2>

    <p>It depends on what you care about most.</p>

    <p>If prospect data depth is everything and you're willing to pay, <strong>PFF</strong> is the clear choice — nobody touches their grades and scouting reports.</p>

    <p>If you want the most realistic draft simulation — where CPU teams actually behave differently, trade with each other, and where you can see every pick land on a real depth chart — <strong>Big Board Lab</strong> is the only tool doing all of that, and it's free.</p>

    <p>If you want a proven, reliable experience with a good trade calculator and multi-team drafting, <strong>FanSpeak</strong> has earned its reputation.</p>

    <p>If you want free and clean with multiple board options, <strong>Pro Football Network</strong> or <strong>StickToTheModel</strong> are both strong.</p>

    <p>If you want CPU-to-CPU trades in a more traditional interface, <strong>NFL Draft Buzz</strong> offers that toggle.</p>

    <p>The best answer is probably to try two or three and see which experience clicks for you. They're mostly free. The draft is April 23. You've got time.</p>
