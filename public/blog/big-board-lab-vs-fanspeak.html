    <div class="verdict">
      <p><strong>The short version:</strong> FanSpeak is the more established tool with multi-team drafting and a proven trade calculator built on the Jimmy Johnson chart. Big Board Lab is newer with a more advanced simulation engine — 32 AI GMs with distinct behavior, CPU-to-CPU trades, and live depth charts. FanSpeak locks key features behind premium. Big Board Lab is fully free.</p>

    <h2>Where FanSpeak Wins</h2>

    <p>Multi-team drafting is FanSpeak's marquee feature. Premium users can control multiple teams in the same draft, which is great for exploring team-specific strategies or doing full 32-team mocks. Big Board Lab doesn't offer this yet.</p>

    <p>The trade calculator is also well-executed. It uses the Jimmy Johnson trade value chart — the same system real NFL front offices reference — with clear fairness indicators showing whether a trade is balanced. In Team Needs mode, CPU teams require you to overpay by at least 100 chart points, simulating real negotiation difficulty. This is a mature, proven system.</p>

    <p>FanSpeak's draft grading breaks down into two clear components: value (did you get good value relative to pick position?) and need (how well did you address roster priorities?). Each pick gets its own grade with slide delta and need priority information.</p>

    <h2>Where Big Board Lab Wins</h2>

    <p>Simulation realism. FanSpeak's CPU teams draft competently but without personality. There's no meaningful difference between how the Saints, Bengals, or Eagles approach the draft in a FanSpeak simulation. Big Board Lab models each team with distinct behavior — BPA vs need preferences, scheme-specific position targeting, reach tolerance, and team stage.</p>

    <p>CPU-to-CPU trades change the entire dynamic. In FanSpeak, only you can trade. The rest of the draft unfolds as a static sequence. In Big Board Lab, AI teams trade with each other based on board evaluation, creating the unpredictability of real draft night. When an elite prospect slides, aggressive teams move up to grab them — you can't predict the board the way you can in a trade-less simulation.</p>

    <p>Live depth charts give you context FanSpeak doesn't provide. Instead of just seeing "Team X needs CB," you can see the actual depth chart — who's starting at CB1, who's at CB2, and whether a drafted corner projects as an immediate upgrade or a developmental pick behind established starters.</p>

    <p>Big Board Lab's trait slider system lets you evaluate prospects at a granular level — sliding arm strength, burst, coverage instincts, and other position-specific attributes up and down to build your own grades. FanSpeak supports custom big boards but doesn't offer a trait-based grading mechanism.</p>

    <h2>The Verdict</h2>

    <p>If multi-team drafting and a proven user-to-CPU trade system are what you want, FanSpeak is the more mature tool for that use case. If you want a simulation that feels more like real draft night — with teams trading around you, each GM behaving differently, and every pick showing its impact on a real roster — Big Board Lab delivers that, and it's free.</p>
