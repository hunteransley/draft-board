    <div class="verdict">
      <p><strong>The short version:</strong> PFF is the best tool for prospect research and data. Big Board Lab is the best tool for realistic draft simulation. PFF costs money for full features. Big Board Lab is free. If you can afford PFF+, use both — PFF for scouting, Big Board Lab for running your mock.</p>

    <h2>Where PFF Wins</h2>

    <p>Prospect data, and it's not close. PFF has three-year player grades for every prospect, advanced metrics like true pass-rush win rate and coverage grades, plus professional scouting reports from Trevor Sikkema. If you want to deeply research a prospect before forming an opinion, PFF's data is the gold standard.</p>

    <p>PFF also offers Scouting Mode — a custom evaluation system where you build your own grades backed by their data. Their leaderboard lets you compete with other users on draft accuracy. And their multiplayer mode lets you draft against friends. These are features Big Board Lab doesn't have yet.</p>

    <h2>Where Big Board Lab Wins</h2>

    <p>Simulation realism. PFF's CPU teams are competent but generic — there's no meaningful difference between how the Saints draft and how the Bengals draft. Big Board Lab models 32 distinct AI general managers with team-specific behavior: BPA vs need preferences, scheme-specific position targeting (3-4 vs 4-3), reach tolerance, and team stage (dynasty, contend, retool, rebuild).</p>

    <p>CPU-to-CPU trades are the biggest gap. In real NFL drafts, teams trade with each other 3-5 times in the first round. PFF's simulation doesn't allow this — only you can trade with the CPU, and only if you're a paid subscriber. Big Board Lab's AI teams trade with each other mid-draft, triggered by elite player slides and team-specific aggressiveness levels.</p>

    <p>Live depth charts are another differentiator PFF doesn't offer. Every pick in Big Board Lab lands on the selecting team's actual ESPN-powered depth chart. You can see whether a player projects as a starter or backup, and how team needs shift after each pick. This context changes how you evaluate picks.</p>

    <p>And price. Big Board Lab offers every feature — 7-round drafts, CPU trades, depth charts, trait grading, instant verdicts — completely free with no signup. PFF locks trades, extended rounds, and Scouting Mode behind a subscription.</p>

    <h2>The Verdict</h2>

    <p>These tools solve different problems. PFF answers "who are the best prospects and why?" Big Board Lab answers "what happens when 32 real-feeling NFL teams draft them?"</p>

    <p>If you're a serious draft analyst who wants the deepest data available, PFF+ is worth the subscription. If you want the most realistic mock draft experience — where the simulation feels like actual draft night with trades, distinct team behavior, and roster impact — Big Board Lab is the better simulator, and it's free.</p>

    <p>The best workflow: research prospects on PFF, then run your board through Big Board Lab's simulation to see how it plays out against 32 AI GMs that actually behave like real NFL teams.</p>
